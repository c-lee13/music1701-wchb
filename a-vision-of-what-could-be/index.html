Passed down countless generations, the origins of the conflict have long been forgotten, replaced by hatred so deeply ingrained that most follow it blindly. Each city clings to a sense of moral superiority, thus birthing a cycle of blame, retribution and endless bloodshed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Could Have Been” echoes the inability of those born into this cycle to break free. The song bemoans how, despite their awareness of the suffering they have caused and despite their longing for a better life, they are powerless to stop violence. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Season 2 Episode 7, we see an alternate reality that is a vibrant paradise. Forged through sacrifice, this hard-fought peace reveals that grief and regret are essential catalysts for societal change – but it is forgiveness and hope that make it possible to break the cycle of violence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distinct differences in the original and new realities raise a deeper question: How can our capacity for emotion empower us to choose a future beyond violence – and more importantly – what does it mean to be human in the face of conflict?</span></p><h3><br><br><strong>Aspirations for Unity: Realized or Ruined?</strong></h3><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/bridge_og-3.png" data-size="1596x680"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/bridge_og-3-thumbnail.png" alt="Destroyed bridge in original universe" width="720" height="307"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/-0XHjDBTXyc?si=qF6rI6ZjJkgNGwzF</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/bridge_new-3.png" data-size="1600x680"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/bridge_new-3-thumbnail.png" alt="Prosperous bridge in new universe" width="720" height="306"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/opy_y0dkwmk?si=Q7TJDKaBklhScGvd</figcaption></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paradoxical imagery of the Bridge is the most striking difference between the two universes: in the original, it is the site of prominent scenes of violence – a monument of inescapable divide. In the new, it is a lively marketplace where Piltovans and Zaunites trade with open hearts – a true landmark of unity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter its ideological significance, the Bridge’s physical structure is a steadfast constant. As all bridges are, it was built from the “desire for connection and movement” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra 2024, 80) – a literal bridging of the geographical rift between the cities. It has always harbored the potential for unification, but whether this potential is fulfilled hinges on how the cities confront violence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the original universe, Piltover and Zaun – both blinded by their thirst for power – have buried this potential underneath chaos and calamity.</span></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Sacrificial Lamb</strong></h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM.png" alt="Powder cradling Vi's corpse" width="2940" height="1252" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-xs.png 640w, https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-sm.png 768w, https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-md.png 1024w, https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-lg.png 1366w, https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-xl.png 1600w, https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-05-at-11.47.45-AM-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>https://youtu.be/5Coo195zKcQ?si=J1j0COfplz35Qsdb</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the alternate universe, conversely, peace is birthed from a single tragic sacrifice: the death of Vi – the death of a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">child</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arturo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra, a theorist specializing in film and game studies with a Ph.D. in Philosophy, argues how the world of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is “governed by… the sacrifice of the guilty” and that this “execution [performs a] social function” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra 2024, 81). Whilst Vi’s death is an instance of this “execution,” it represents a sacrifice of the innocent – not the guilty. This crucial distinction emphasizes how innocents are often caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cruel as it may be, Vi’s death was the necessary sacrifice that forced society to confront the gravity of its own injustice and inhumanity. By deeply stirring society’s regret and grief, her death serves the social function of kickstarting reconciliation, ensuring no other innocent suffers her fate in this needless war.</span></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Forgiven, But Never Forgotten</strong></h3><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/vander_slico_fight.jpg" data-size="x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/vander_slico_fight-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Vander and Silco fighting in the original universe" width="720" height="360"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/Lxyg0oDX6kg?si=eTV3TccguJNOXJUi</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/vs_reconciled.jpeg" data-size="2069x877"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/7/gallery/vs_reconciled-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Vander and Silco reconciled in the new universe" width="720" height="305"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/XI5EdDoCp5k?si=gy6EYB2PYC6HeZpm</figcaption></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for progress is thus realized in the new universe, primarily demonstrated through <a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/definitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vander and Silco</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s reconciliation: although injuries – Silco’s marred eye and Vander’s maimed arm – from their vicious brawl linger, they have found peace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Mell-Taylor, a writer enthusiastic in pop culture and politics, argues that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oversimplifies peace, where the show’s failure to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">undo the generations of economic and political inequality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” makes it unlikely to achieve an “end [to] … violence” (Alex Has Opinions 2025). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as how the Bridge remains, a constant reminder of the bitter destruction of the past and of the unchangeable geographical separation of the cities, Vander and Silco’s previous mistakes are forever etched onto their souls. Mell-Taylor rightfully points out how such deeply ingrained wounds can never be erased. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, though divide will always persist, unity can still be achieved. Unity is far from a “permanent realignment,” (Alex Has Opinions 2025) which implies the elimination of all differences. Rather unity is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of divide: the realization that there is still great potential for cohesion amidst divide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paralleling how the Bridge has turned into a prosperous marketplace, by accepting their grievous injuries as part of their identity and by choosing forgiveness, the brothers prevent pain and anger from corrupting their actions. These scars then become symbols to inspire positive change, allowing them to finally break free from the cycle of violence.</span></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Hope To Conquer Violence</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unfair and naive to compare the world of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to our modern reality. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is, after all, a fictional story. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is much to learn even from a work of fiction. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world already rife with pessimism, is it not better to embrace the hope that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers, rather than succumb to a despair that breeds inaction?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By replacing the desolation of “What Could Have Been” with renewed hope, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">illustrates that while it is humanity’s intense emotional capacity – for hatred and agony – that fuels the cycle of violence, it is that same depth of feeling – for regret and grief, forgiveness and hope – that gives us the power to overcome it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows us what it means to be human: to be capable of great evil, but also great good. We cannot escape from our mistakes or losses, but we do have the power to choose how these experiences shape us. To have the strength to look past our grievances, to acknowledge our differences, and to seek unity despite them. To make the conscious decision to step out of the cycle of violence, and to hold onto hope that – through our efforts – a better future awaits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the essence of progress. This spark of hope is what transforms “What Could Have Been” into “What Can Be.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may start small, like mending bonds between families. But this seemingly trivial step has the potential to ignite something far greater: true societal change.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/conclusion/">Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
