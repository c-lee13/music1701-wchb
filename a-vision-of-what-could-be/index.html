Passed down countless generations, their respective inhabitants have long since forgotten the origins of this conflict. So thoroughly ingrained within their identities and lifestyles, most merely embrace this hate without ever questioning the reason behind it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Could Have Been” echoes the inability of those born into this cycle to break free. The song bemoans how despite their awareness of the hurt they have caused and despite their longing for a better life, violence has become too intrinsic and they are powerless to change. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Season 2 Episode 7, we see an alternate reality that is a vibrant paradise, bustling with prosperity and joy. This new reality contrasts the originally bleak Piltover and Zaun, begetting the question of how it came to be.</span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Coo195zKcQ?si=pJDAdKm_6_M-HTtX" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, what does it take, and more importantly, what does it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to break free of such a cycle of violence? </span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Aspirations for Unity: Realized or Ruined?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paradoxical imagery of the Bridge is the most striking difference between the two universes: in one, it is the site of prominent scenes of violence – a monument of inescapable divide. In the other, it is a lively marketplace where Piltovans and Zaunites trade with wide smiles and open hearts – a true landmark of prosperity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter its ideological significance, the Bridge’s physical structure is a steadfast constant. As all bridges are, it was built from the “desire for connection and movement” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra 80) – a literal bridging of the geographical rift between the cities. It has always harbored the potential for unification, but whether this potential is fulfilled hinges on how the cities confront violence. </span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Sacrificial Lamb</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the original universe, this potential is buried beneath chaos and calamity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blinded by their thirst for power over one another, the two cities have soon lost sight of their initial promise of harmony. Instead, a theme of bloodlust arises, as seen through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s ever escalating scenes of conflict and destruction. With each city possessing a sense of moral superiority over the other, a cycle of blame is borne – one in which retribution is pursued through the relentless spilling of blood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra’s argument of how the world of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is “governed by… the sacrifice of the guilty” and that this “execution [performs the] social function” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encinas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantalapiedra 80-81) of temporarily satiating this bloodlust. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a crucial distinction must be made upon his argument: the person punished as “guilty” is often </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guilty. </span></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the alternate universe, Vi’s death is an instance of this “execution”. Her death – that of a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">child</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – serves the social purpose of exposing how innocents are caught in the crossfire of violence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cruel as it may be, it is the necessary sacrifice that forces society to confront the gravity of its own injustice and inhumanity. By striking society’s conscience so profoundly that it sparks a movement toward reconciliation, Vi’s death ensures that no other innocent suffers the same fate in this needless war.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Forgiven, But Never Forgotten</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for progress is thus realized in this second universe, primarily demonstrated through Vander and Silco’s reconciliation: although injuries – Silco’s marred eye and Vander’s maimed arm – from their vicious brawl linger, they have found peace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mell-Taylor argues that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents an oversimplification of peace, where the show’s failure to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">undo the generations of economic and political inequality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” makes it unlikely to achieve the “permanent realignment” needed for an “end [to] the cycle of violence” (Alex Has Opinions 2025). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as how the Bridge remains, a constant reminder of the bitter destruction of the past and of the unchangeable geographical separation of the cities, Vander and Silco’s previous mistakes are forever etched onto their souls. Mell-Taylor rightfully points out how it is impossible for such deeply ingrained wounds to ever be erased. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, though divide will always persist, that does not mean unity cannot be achieved. Unity is far from a complete “realignment,” which implies the elimination of all differences. Rather unity is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of divide: the realization that despite this divide, there still is great potential for cohesion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, paralleling how the Bridge has turned into a prosperous marketplace, the brothers’ acceptance of their grievous injuries as an irrevocable part of their identity, coupled with their strength to forgive, allows them not to let pain and anger corrupt their actions. Instead, by viewing these scars as symbols to inspire growth and positive change, they are finally able to break free from the cycle of violence.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Hope To Conquer Violence</strong></h3><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unfair, and naive, to compare the world of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to our modern reality. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not provide an explicit explanation for the resolution of material inequalities between Piltover and Zaun, because ultimately, it is a fictional story. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is much to learn even from a work of fiction. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world already rife with pessimism, is it not more beneficial to embrace the hope that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers, rather than succumb to a despair that begets a cycle of inaction and to think that we will inevitably “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">return to the status quo the day after disaster ends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (Alex Has Opinions 2025)? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows us what it means to be human: to be capable of great evil, but also great good. We cannot escape from our mistakes or loss, but we do have the power to choose how these experiences shape us. To have the strength to look past our grievances, to acknowledge our differences, and to seek unity despite them. To make the conscious decision to step out of the cycle of violence, and to hold onto hope that, through our efforts, a better future awaits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the true essence of progress.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may start small, like mending bonds between families. But this seemingly trivial step has the potential to ignite something far greater: true societal change.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/conclusion/">Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
