The song’s fusion of orchestral and pop elements reflects a broader trend in contemporary music where genre boundaries are increasingly fluid. As Gran (2004) explains, orchestral-pop hybrids must balance the emotional immediacy of pop with the expressive depth of orchestral arrangements -- a balance this piece strikes through Sting’s evocative delivery and Ray Chen’s virtuosic strings. Kozeny (2024) asserts that the integration of orchestral elements enhances pop’s emotional power, with the cinematic grandeur of orchestration elevating listener immersion. Similarly, Hodge (2024) highlights how classical arrangements deepen pop's emotional resonance, bridging cultural divides and transforming the audience’s perception.</p><p data-start="921" data-end="1652">Kublawi (2022) contemplates the origins of the dystopian divide between Piltover and Zaun, questioning whether the dystopia is created by corrupt dynastic rulers or whether it is an inevitable, fate-driven fracture between the cities. She presents two interpretations: first, that the systemic oppression perpetuated by the unjust governments of Piltover and Zaun -- embodied in the Piltover council and Zaun’s chem-barons -- creates the dystopia; and second, that the cities’ separation is preordained, a product of destiny itself. This duality resonates with <em data-start="1498" data-end="1506">Arcane</em>’s exploration of power dynamics, as both the narrative and music underscore the destructive consequences of entrenched leadership and corruption.</p><p data-start="1654" data-end="2823">This intersection of genres in the song mirrors <em data-start="1702" data-end="1710">Arcane</em>’s thematic shift: from a worldbuilding focus built on leitmotifs to a raw, emotional resonance that centers on human grief and personal struggle. As the show transitions from sociopolitical commentary to more intimate, character-driven narratives, the song emphasizes the cost of war -- not only in terms of lives lost but also the futures never realized. In doing so, <em data-start="2077" data-end="2099">What Could Have Been</em> becomes a powerful meditation on the irreversible impact of these conflicts. And yet, despite its sorrowful tone, the song leaves room for hope. Drawing on Luzong’s (2021) observation that <em data-start="2289" data-end="2297">Arcane</em> is a story about humanity’s flaws -- about how people strive for good but often fail and, in doing so, perpetuate evil -- the song evokes a sense of possibility. As Kublawi (2022) suggests, even if the fracturing of Piltover and Zaun seems inevitable, there remains the potential for individuals to shape their destinies. Despite the oppressive reign of corrupt leaders, the song affirms the capacity of the individual to rise above violence and prejudice, to strive for self-improvement, and, ultimately, to create a better world.</p><p data-start="2825" data-end="3077">In this way, the music in "What Could Have Been" serves not only as a vessel for mourning but also as a medium for envisioning the potential for change -- an invitation to imagine a future that still holds hope, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/a-vision-of-what-could-be/">Back to "A Vision of What Can Be"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/bibliography/">Bibliography</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
