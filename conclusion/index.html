The song’s blending of orchestral and pop elements exemplifies a broader trend in contemporary music where genre boundaries are increasingly fluid. As Gran (2004) explains, orchestral-pop hybrids must capture the emotional extroversion of pop while staying true to the orchestra’s expressive depth—a balance this piece strikes through Sting’s poignant delivery and Ray Chen’s virtuosic strings. Kozeny (2024) furthers this point by asserting that orchestral integration can amplify pop’s emotional power, noting how cinematic grandeur elevates listener immersion. Likewise, Hodge (2024) reflects on how classical arrangements deepen pop’s affective reach, transforming audience perception and bridging cultural divides. This intersection of genres mirrors Arcane’s thematic pivot: the transition from leitmotif-based worldbuilding to raw emotional resonance parallels how the show shifts from grand sociopolitical commentary to intimate human grief. Through this shift, the song underscores the cost of war—not just in lives lost, but in futures never realized. And yet, the song does not end in despair. “What Could Have Been” evokes the longing for reconciliation, for the paths not taken, and ultimately for hope. As Allia Luzong reminds us, Arcane is a story of flawed humanity—of people who try, fail, and sometimes harm—but who also have the capacity to choose again. In this way, music becomes a vessel not only for mourning, but for imagining what still could be.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/a-vision-of-what-could-be/">Back to "A Vision of What Can Be"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/bibliography/">Bibliography</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
