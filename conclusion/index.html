Through not only its sophisticated musical composition – with its lyrical depth and passionate violin arrangements – but also its expert intersection into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s narrative, the song channels raw emotion from audiences, enabling us to empathize and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each and every character. This experiential immersion thus bridges the show’s fictional setting to our reality, enhancing parallels between the two – parallels of love, grief, family, and violence. These parallels then serve to both propel and define dynamics within our modern society. </span></p><hr><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, “What Could Have Been” illustrates an evolutionary mindset surrounding pop and orchestral music. Charles Lawrence Gran, a scholar with a Ph.D. in Philosophy in Music, identifies a long-standing conflict between these genres, asserting how pop music embraces modern trends in society (as with the integration of lyrics), whilst orchestral music remains reluctant to change its traditionally acoustic sounds (Gran 2004, 21). Yet recently, writers covering entertainment media for popular magazines have pointed out a shift toward greater genre fluidity. Pop music’s embrace of orchestral elements, they argue, has the ability to “amplify rather than diminish contemporary pop production” (Kozeny 2024) through imbuing “a depth of soul” into the traditional pop performance (Hodge 2024). Therefore, this blend of genre aims to allow audiences to engage with the music on a deeper emotional level. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Could Have Been”'s fusion of pop and orchestral elements into a heart-wrenching piece, consequently, emphasizes how this unity between different genres intensifies music’s emotional resonance with audiences, hence deepening their connection to the song.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This intersection of genres in the song mirrors </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s thematic shift from socio-political commentary to more intimate, character-driven narratives. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the former, focusing on the politics and societal divide between Piltover and Zaun, Virginia Kublawi, a frequent writer on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geeks + Gamers </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a popular game blogging site), presents two possible origins of the war between the cities: either as the result of decades of systemic oppression by unjust governments, or as a predetermined fate (Kublawi 2022). Whilst “What Could Have Been” dwells in the despair of war's irreversible damage, I propose a more hopeful vision in “A Vision of What Can Be.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allia Luzong, a writer with a professional background in psychology, likewise observes how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not a story about politics, but a story about humanity – about how people “[try] and [fail] to do good and, in the process, [do] evil” (Luzong 2021). This perspective therefore underscores humankind’s enduring capacity to transcend violence and prejudice, to pursue self-betterment, and ultimately to shape a more just and compassionate world. </span></p><hr><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In uniting musical innovation with profound moral inquiry, “What Could Have Been” not only encapsulates the emotional and thematic core of Arcane, but also invites audiences to reflect on the complexities of human nature and the transformative power of forgiveness and empathy in a world divided by conflict.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/a-vision-of-what-could-be/">Back to "A Vision of What Can Be"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/bibliography/">Bibliography</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
