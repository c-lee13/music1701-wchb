This, in turn, boosts consumer engagement from both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players and the general public, highlighting the video game industry’s shift towards transmediality where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">various media forms (like songs or films) contribute uniquely to an overarching narrative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/8/gallery/kda_mv.jpg" data-size="1280x720"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/8/gallery/kda_mv-thumbnail.jpg" alt="K/DA 'Pop Stars': Music Video Wallpaper" width="720" height="405"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/UOxkGD8qRB4?si=TdNbG1ygCEVrgk-F</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/8/gallery/kda.jpeg" data-size="1296x729"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/8/gallery/kda-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="K/DA Live Performance" width="720" height="405"></a><figcaption>https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0826%2Fr736941_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg</figcaption></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Febrer-Coll first illustrates the evolution of storytelling in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League of Legends </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">since the game’s release, emphasizing how music videos and live performances not only breathe life into its characters, but also deepen players’ emotional connection to the game. Subsequently, she turns to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the most experimental – yet faithful – transmedia extension of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s universe to date. She examines how this new animated storytelling similarly leverages its soundtrack to enhance relatability, allowing viewers to “find their own experience of the world reflected in [the show]” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 75-76). And with “Enemy” as a case study, she highlights how music can give voice to characters, revealing their inner conflict and elevating the audience’s emotional experience through “[alluding] to [their] memory… and to their familiarity with what they hear” (79). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaving in diverse qualitative and quantitative sources, Febrer-Coll then answers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exactly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is so effective in catering to such a wide spectrum of viewers. She pulls sources from social media about the reception of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which depict great excitement in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fandom around the show’s musical elements – even compelling a fan to compile a list of character-specific leitmotifs (Febrer-Coll 2023, 77). Moreover, she assembles her own source: a comprehensive survey of 425 responses, with “96.5% of respondents (considering) the music to be a good complement to the series (48.5%) or even to make it more attractive (48%)” (81), further underscoring how music heightens audience engagement. Finally, drawing concepts from a peer-reviewed university thesis by Juan Sebastián Díaz Gasca (a professor in the field of popular music), she frames her overarching argument about the impact of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s music within three categories: Experiential, Socio-cultural, and Economic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her discussion of the experiential influence of the soundtrack, Febrer-Coll argues that “the narrative approach of the songs allows an association between the everyday and the fantastic” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 83), highlighting music’s ability to transform </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from mere television to a raw reflection of reality. Her case study of “Enemy” reveals “a critique of a society that seems intent on creating division” (78). This claim further underscores how this music, though specifically curated for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, embodies a wider narrative of society and effectively relates to the show’s audience. Moreover, the show’s juxtaposition of rich and poor, privileged and oppressed, portrays how each character’s upbringing shapes their identity. This concept is emphasized through leitmotifs: “the psychological development of the main character, Jinx, [is depicted] through the modulation of the sound fragment that represents her in different scenes” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 77), where societal prejudice is the driving factor for Jinx’s character progression. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequent categories around the socio-cultural and economic impact of music arise from its experiential success and focus more on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League of Legends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. Febrer-Coll asserts that music summons the players’ pride and passion for the game, through “the recognition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a gamer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through music… [and thus reaffirming the] role of fandom” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 83; emphasis original). This unification of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community – in addition to the attraction of new players – boosts the economic consumption of the game, proving the immense benefits that transmedia products bestow upon the video game industry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst her discussion of socio-cultural and economic impacts of transmediality remains significant to consumerism in the industry, they rely heavily upon music’s experiential impact. A deeper analysis of experientiality is hence needed. In choosing “Enemy” as her sole case study (a song played only in the opening sequence), she loses out on the most significant intersection between television and music: film-scoring. Film-scoring involves composing original music – such as soundtracks, leitmotifs, and background music – and aligning them with visuals and timings, thereby enhancing a show’s emotional impact. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of leitmotifs, though she does state the presence of Jinx’s leitmotif, she fails to examine </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly it embodies Jinx’s character. As for soundtracks, she notes that “each [song] gives specific scenes an explicit narrativity… with lyrics that reinforce the visuals” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 76). Here, she provides only a brief comment on these songs’ lyrical contributions, although lyrics are crucial to grasping their emotional impact. Therefore, an additional case study of a song simultaneously involving the leitmotif of a character and reflecting the intensity of the scene – through both lyrics and musical composition – would have greatly reinforced her argument of music’s emotional influence. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Eulalia Febrer-Coll offers a critical analysis of music in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighting its role in representing characters’ personalities and charting their growth. She reveals that this impact allows the audience to relate personally to the characters, enabling music to bridge the chasm between the fantasy setting of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the reality of our modern world. While she could strengthen her claim about the experiential effect of music with direct evidence on film-scoring, her thorough statistical analysis still effectively demonstrates transmediality’s role in driving consumerism within the video game industry. By presenting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the outstanding example of transmediality, she reinforces how the industry must diversify its media formats to further the emotional impact of its storytelling. This strategy not only deepens the engagement within the fandom, but also appeals to the wider public, hence shaping the future of video game storytelling.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/introduction/">Back to "Introduction"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/lyrics/">Lyrics to "What Could Have Been"</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
