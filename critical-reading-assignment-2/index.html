Through examining the effectiveness of music in evoking concrete emotions from both pre-existing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players and the general audience, she underscores the turn of the video game industry towards transmedia products beyond the game itself. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Febrer-Coll first illustrates the evolution of storytelling in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League of Legends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, emphasizing how music videos and live performances not only breathe life into its characters, but also deepen the players’ emotional connection to the game. Subsequently, she delves into how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s soundtrack enhances relatability, allowing viewers to “find their own experience of the world reflected in (the show)” (Febrer-Coll, 75-76). And with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enemy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a case study, she highlights how music can give voice to characters, revealing their inner conflict and elevating the audience’s emotional experience through “(alluding) to (their) memory… and to their familiarity with what they hear” (Febrer-Coll, 79). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaving in diverse qualitative and quantitative sources, Febrer-Coll then answers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exactly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is so effective in catering to such a wide spectrum of viewers. She pulls sources from social media about the reception of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depicting great excitement in the fandom around the show’s musical elements, which even compelled a fan to compile a list of character-specific leitmotifs (Febrer-Coll, 77). Moreover, she assembles her own source: a comprehensive survey of 425 responses, with “96.5% of respondents (considering) the music to be a good complement to the series (48.5%) or even to make it more attractive (48%)” (Febrer-Coll, 81), further underscoring how music heightens the emotional and intellectual engagement of the audience. Finally, drawing concepts from a peer-reviewed university thesis, she frames her overarching argument about the impact of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s music within three categories: Experiential, Socio-cultural, and Economic. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her discussion of the experiential influence of the soundtrack, Febrer-Coll argues that “the narrative approach of the songs allows an association between the everyday and the fantastic” (Febrer-Coll, 83), highlighting music’s ability to transform </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from mere television to a raw reflection of reality. Her case study on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enemy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals “a critique of a society that seems intent on creating division” (Febrer-Coll, 78). This claim further underscores how music, though specifically curated for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, comes to embody a wider narrative of society, proving effective in its relatability with the audience. Moreover, the show’s juxtaposition of rich and poor – privileged and oppressed – portrays how each character’s upbringing shapes their identity. This concept is emphasized through leitmotifs: “the psychological development of the main character, Jinx, (is depicted) through the modulation of the sound fragment that represents her in different scenes” (Febrer-Coll, 77), where societal prejudice is the driving factor for Jinx’s character progression. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequent categories around the socio-cultural and economic impact of music arise from its experiential success and focus more on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League of Legends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. Febrer-Coll asserts that music summons the players’ pride and passion for the game, through “the recognition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a gamer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through music… (and thus reaffirming the) role of fandom” (Febrer-Coll, 83). This unification of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community – in addition to the attraction of new players – boosts the economic consumption of the game, proving the immense benefits that transmedia products bestow upon the video game industry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, with her argument about transmedia benefits relying so heavily upon music’s experiential impact, a deeper analysis of experientiality is needed. In choosing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enemy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as her sole case study (a song played only in the opening sequence), she loses out on the most significant intersection between television and music: film-scoring. Encompassing musical forms such as soundtracks and leitmotifs, film-scoring entails the “(reimagining) and (reworking of the composers’) work (to enhance) the narrative of the piece to intervene in the (audience’s) emotions” (Febrer-Coll, 77). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of leitmotifs, to strengthen her argument of how they trace Jinx’s mental progression, she could have identified and examined the leitmotif itself and how it musically embodies the character. As for soundtracks, she notes that “each (song) gives specific scenes an explicit narrativity… with lyrics that reinforce the visuals” (Febrer-Coll, 76), providing only brief comments on these songs’ lyrical contributions, whilst neglecting their emotional impact. Therefore, an additional case study of a song simultaneously involving the leitmotif of a character and reflecting the intensity of the scene – through both lyrics and musical intonation – would have greatly reinforced her argument of music’s emotional influence. </span></p><p class="align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Eulalia Febrer-Coll offers a thorough and critical analysis of music in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlighting its role in representing characters’ personalities and charting their growth. She reveals that this impact enables music to bridge the chasm between fantasy and reality, allowing the audience to relate personally to the thoughts of the characters and events in the series. Whilst her claim about the experiential effect of music could be strengthened with more direct evidence on film-scoring, her following assertions around the positive sociocultural and economic impact of music effectively demonstrates the crucial role of transmediality in driving consumerism within the video game industry. And by presenting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the outstanding embodiment of transmediality – the intersection between game lore, popular music and entrancing animation – she reinforces the importance of the industry embracing unique forms of media to tell a compelling and emotionally-electric story. This strategy not only deepens the engagement within the fandom, but also appeals to the wider public, hence shaping the future of video game storytelling.</span></p><p><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/introduction/">Back to "Introduction"</a></p><p><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/lyrics/">Lyrics to "What Could Have Been"</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
