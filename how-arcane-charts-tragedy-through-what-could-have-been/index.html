When the sisters finally reunite, Jinx has already been weaponized into a ruthless killer. She is completely unrecognizable to Vi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the diligent hands of artists from the animation company Fortiche, this narrative was brought to life. Animation itself, however, is silent. To truly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speak</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the audience, animation must undergo the process of film-scoring – the alignment of sounds with visuals to elevate the scene’s ambience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From character themes to orchestral symphonies, these stunning blends of music into animation rigorously advance the show’s narrative and embody the characters’ emotions. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the heart of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> musical storytelling lies its soundtrack.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>“What Could Have Been”</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Season One’s comprehensive 11 song tracklist, one song stands out. Sung by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">17-time Grammy award winning artist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sting and featuring renowned violinist Ray Chen, “What Could Have Been” is a lyrical and instrumental masterpiece that captures </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s emotionally tumultuous story.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song’s grand feature in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Season One finale resembles a music video, contextualizing the song within the narrative. Building upon its standard audio recording, this film-scoring further amplifies each character’s anguish, extending these emotions beyond the screen to resonate with audiences. It highlights the emotional motivations and societal dynamics that shape the characters, hence allowing audiences to better understand their actions.</span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJV_-5nciN0?si=128NOseT6EPEGnTm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p> </p><h3><strong>Despair and Grief: The Tragedy of Broken Sisters</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both versions open with a piano playing faintly in the background – the same treble note loops over and over, pushed along only by a slow but steady descent of the bass note. Yet they sound muffled, an intentional choice by executive music producer Alexander Seaver. By laying a physical “felt pad” over the strings, the hammers strike felt before string, creating a “delicate and intimate sound” (Seaver 2021, at 22:08-26). This haunting drumming rhythm, accompanied by Sting’s whisper-like delivery of “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the monster you created,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” results in an eerie sense of brokenness. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in her childhood, Jinx has always been “broken” – every time she tries to help her family, she causes a catastrophe. Her undoing comes in the finale, when Vi – the only family she has left – seemingly deserts her. Consequently, the animation portrays Jinx as a solitary figure facing the vast and sinister world beyond (Riot Games 2021, at 0:46-58), echoing her profound sense of abandonment and therefore bestowing greater weight to her brokenness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following “I hope you know we had everything” then underscores the contrast between  the sisters’ happy childhood and their sorrowful present. This lyric dangles the knowledge of imminent destruction above us. The animation then cuts away from Jinx, deliberately giving us time to reflect on the circumstances that led to this finale. Regret is thus induced, where we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“yearn for … the [happier] beginning of the narrative” (Díaz Gasca 2013, 100). But mere regret cannot turn back time – the consequences of our actions cannot be forgotten. This longing for something unattainable intensifies the sorrow of the moment, reinforcing how music’s intersection with animation heightens the show’s emotional impact.</span></p><h3><strong>Desperation: Jinx’s Violin <a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/definitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leitmotif</a></strong></h3><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="33.3333%" height="20%" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1lYSJecfZV0lFIslHpAwRz?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right before Jinx fires her rocket towards Piltover, a brief violin interlude plays. Keen-eared audiences might notice the violin’s recurring presence in Jinx’s key scenes: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0avYW6GqSrD5XAw8XkLkJn?si=0b529c4ecd064ebd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissonant harmonics</a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heightening the unease when Jinx releases her first hextech monkey bomb; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2I8Lw1STTjwylhMMZPlA2E?si=8fa3b6e4b2144205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erratic double-stops</a></span></span><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscoring her mental chaos upon seeing someone resembling Vi. The violin is, consequently, Jinx’s leitmotif throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plotting her “psychological development… through the modulation of [its] sound fragment” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 77). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer anguish Jinx experiences here can only be fully encapsulated in the video version of “What Could Have Been” (Riot Games 2021, at 1:28-1:33), where the outline of Jinx’s body is splintered apart by the rocket’s blinding energy. This imagery, coupled with the shrill and fragile pitch of the violin, symbolizes Jinx’s mind at its breaking point – her final plea for help.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Music as Storytelling: A Shattered Society</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sting cries out: “Why don’t you love who I am?” as Jinx fires her rocket in the finale. This synchronized animation and music offers a second interpretation of “What Could Have Been”, beyond a fractured family: how societal divide poisons lives. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera pans to different characters, highlighting how the war between the two cities has scarred each of them: </span></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/sevika_arm.jpeg" data-size="640x376"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/sevika_arm-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Sevika losing her arm to protect Silco" width="640" height="376"></a><figcaption>https://preview.redd.it/s1-spoilers-was-rewatching-and-noticed-they-kept-the-wrong-v0-j07boy0abevd1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0220dddde8efc861de81e4e52ee8b34edb93074</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-3.24.44-AM.png" data-size="2926x1244"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-3.24.44-AM-thumbnail.png" alt="Young Ekko fixing a mechanism" width="720" height="306"></a><figcaption>https://youtu.be/llfyePsCK5c?si=mRHhCseY3_vX1EZ4</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/singed.jpeg" data-size="391x280"><img loading="lazy" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/media/posts/5/gallery/singed-thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Singed holding his shimmer serum" width="391" height="280"></a><figcaption>https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/images/thumb/Singed_Arcane_3_Render.png/391px-Singed_Arcane_3_Render.png?d1086</figcaption></figure></div></div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevika</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose loyalty to Zaun costs her an arm.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekko</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose “inferior” Zaunite upbringing stifles his potential. </span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singed</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose fatherly love turns him into a monster. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are thus made acutely aware of the true scale of the consequences of societal strife – that it destroys two entire societies, rather than merely two sisters (as in the audio recording). Furthermore, the animation primes audiences with the knowledge of just how close Zaun and Piltover were to achieving “peace,” allowing them to better resonate with the heart-wrenching regret behind Sting’s final delivery of “what could have been.” This interpretation ties back to Seaver’s description of Sting as the “global narrator of everything” (Seaver 2021, at 19.27-40), lamenting the tragedy of the twin cities.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What Could Have Been” harbors so much emotion, not only with its heavy lyrical connotations, but also with Sting’s hard-hitting delivery and a vibrant classical backing. Though sacrifices must be made to ensure the song fits the scene, as with the scene’s omission of Ray Chen’s angelic violin solo, the combination of song and animation effectively imparts the emotional intensity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s finale to its audience. This emotional resonance allows audiences to empathize with the characters’ seemingly unjustifiable actions, whereby – fuelled by the rage and agony of their suffering – they are forcibly engulfed by the endless cycle of violence.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/vi/">The Lover and The Fighter</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
