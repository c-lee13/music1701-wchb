When the sisters finally reunite, Jinx has already been weaponized into a ruthless killer. She is completely unrecognizable to Vi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the diligent hands of artists from the animation company Fortiche, this narrative was brought to life. Animation itself, however, is silent. To truly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speak</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the audience, animation must undergo the process of film-scoring – both mimicking sounds from the natural world and inventing new sounds to elevate the scene’s ambience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From character themes to orchestral symphonies, these stunning blends of music into animation, curated by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s musical artists, rigorously advance the show’s narrative and embody the characters’ emotions. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the heart of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> musical storytelling, lies its soundtrack.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>“What Could Have Been”</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Season One’s comprehensive 11 song tracklist, one song stands out. Sung by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">17-time Grammy award winning artist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sting, and featuring renowned violinist Ray Chen, “What Could Have Been” is a lyrical and instrumental masterpiece that captures the emotionally tumultuous story of the two sisters and the two cities. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song’s grand feature in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Season One finale resembles a music video. This intersection between animation and sound contextualizes the song within the narrative, revealing a broader and more emotional significance as compared to its standard audio recording.</span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJV_-5nciN0?si=128NOseT6EPEGnTm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p> </p><h3><strong>Despair and Grief: The Tragedy of Broken Sisters</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both versions open with a piano playing faintly in the background – the same treble note loops over and over, pushed along only by a slow but steady descent of the bass note. Yet they sound muffled, an intentional choice by executive music producer Alexander Seaver: by laying a physical “felt pad” over the strings, the hammers strike felt before string, creating a “delicate and intimate sound” (Seaver 2021 at 22:08-26). This haunting drumming rhythm, accompanied by Sting’s whisper-like delivery of “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the monster you created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, results in an eerie sense of brokenness. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in her childhood, Jinx has always been ‘broken’ – every time she tries to help her family, she causes a catastrophe. Her undoing comes in the finale, when Vi – the only family she has left – seemingly deserts her. Consequently, the animation portrays Jinx as a solitary figure facing the vast and sinister world beyond (Riot Games 2021, at 0:46-58), echoing her profound sense of abandonment and therefore bestowing greater weight to her brokenness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following “I hope you know we had everything” then underscores the contrast between  the sisters’ happy childhood and their sorrowful present. This lyric intensifies the tension in the scene, dangling the knowledge of imminent destruction above us. The animation then cuts away from Jinx, deliberately giving us time to reflect on the circumstances that led to this finale. Regret is thus induced, where we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“yearn for … the [happier] beginning of the narrative” (Díaz Gasca 2013, 100), depicting how music’s intersection with animation heightens the emotional impact of the scene.</span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Desperation: Jinx’s Violin <a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/tags/leitmotif-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leitmotif</a></strong></h3><p class="align-center">(note: i'm not sure why the tags aren't working right now, but the link is supposed to direct user to a page which specifies:</p><p class="align-center">"Definition of Leitmotif: “An associated melodic phrase or figure that accompanies the reappearance of an idea, person, or situation,” given by Merriam-Webster. 2025.")</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0avYW6GqSrD5XAw8XkLkJn?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="152" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2I8Lw1STTjwylhMMZPlA2E?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right before Jinx fires her rocket towards Piltover (seeking revenge against the corrupt city), a brief violin interlude plays. Keen-eared audiences might notice the violin’s recurring presence in Jinx’s key scenes: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dissonant harmonics</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heightening the unease when Jinx releases her first hextech monkey bomb; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">erratic double-stops</span></span><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscoring her mental chaos upon seeing someone resembling Vi. The violin is, consequently, Jinx’s leitmotif throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plotting her “psychological development… through the modulation of [its] sound fragment” (Febrer-Coll 2023, 77). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer anguish Jinx experiences here can only be fully encapsulated in the video version of “What Could Have Been” (Riot Games 2021, at 1:28-1:33), where the outline of Jinx’s body (in these frames) is splintered apart by the blinding energy from the rocket. This imagery, coupled with the shrill and fragile pitch of the violin, symbolizes Jinx’s mind at its breaking point – her final plea for help. </span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Music as Storytelling: A Shattered Society</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sting cries out: “Why don’t you love who I am?” as Jinx fires her rocket in the finale, and the synchronized animation and music offers a second interpretation of “What Could Have Been”, beyond a fractured family: how societal divide poisons lives. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera pans to different characters, highlighting how the war between the two cities has scarred each of them: </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevika</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose loyalty to Zaun costs her an arm.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekko</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose ‘inferior’ Zaunite upbringing stifles his potential. </span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singed</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – whose fatherly love turns him into a monster. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are thus made acutely aware of the true scale of the consequences of societal strife – that it destroys two entire societies, rather than merely two sisters (as in the audio recording). Furthermore, the animation primes audiences with the knowledge of just how close Zaun and Piltover were to achieving ‘peace’, allowing them to better resonate with the heart-wrenching regret behind Sting’s final delivery of “what could have been”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interpretation ties back to Seaver’s description of Sting as the “global narrator of everything” (Seaver 2021 at 19.27-40), lamenting the tragedy of the twin cities.</span></p><p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">With heavy lyrical connotations, coupled with Sting’s hard-hitting delivery and a vibrant classical backing, “What Could Have Been” harbors so much emotion. But listening to it in tandem with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s animation gives it an even deeper significance, allowing audiences to better appreciate the effort behind film-scoring. Though sacrifices must be made to ensure the song fits the scene, as with the scene’s omission of Ray Chen’s angelic violin solo, the combination of song and animation effectively imparts the core themes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its audience: It is a story of two sisters who have lost themselves and each other, as well as a tale of the rift between two cities, where prejudice and privilege have destroyed the lives of so many.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/vi/">The Lover and The Fighter</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
