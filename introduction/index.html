As a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) with each controllable “champion” possessing a unique skillset, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> soon skyrocketed in popularity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally desiring to reach a broader audience, Riot Games began experimenting with adaptations of media outside of the game. The music video for “Warriors” by Imagine Dragons then became Riot’s first breakthrough, amassing over 440 million YouTube views since its release. Its widespread appeal stems from the experiential impact of music and animation on audiences. As Díaz Gasca (2013) defines, experientiality elicits two key emotional responses from audiences. The first is “character association,” which links specific sounds to characters and thereby reinforces audiences’ understanding of the characters’ emotions. The second is “nostalgia,” which evokes sentiments of longing or regret, hence enhancing audiences’ emotional connection to the narrative. By integrating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lore into music and animation, “Warriors” revealed a critical demand for experiential immersion into the game, thus playing a pivotal role in inspiring Riot’s first full-fledged animated television series: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a compelling narrative about how societal conflict (between two cities: the privileged Piltover and the oppressed Zaun) fractures the relationship between two sisters, Jinx and Vi. Their lives are thus shaped by war, betrayal, and the pursuit of vengeance. A recurring theme throughout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s narrative is consequently the cyclic nature of violence, whereby society’s infliction of harm upon families and individuals spurs them to pursue retribution through further violence. Music, predominantly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s soundtrack, plays an integral role in emphasizing this motif. </span><strong>Through the soundtrack’s experiential impact upon audiences, </strong><strong><i>Arcane</i></strong><strong> emphasizes its characters’ hatred and agony, highlighting how these corrosive emotions sweep them into the cycle of violence. </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Febrer-Coll (2023) provides a case study of how one of these songs, “Enemy” by Imagine Dragons, reflects how Jinx’s loss has transformed her into a volatile, hatred-driven individual – the perfect weapon to retaliate against Piltover’s brutality. In “When Story Meets Sound,” however, I propose examining how another song – “What Could Have Been” – further aids audiences in understanding the emotional motivations driving Jinx’s violent actions. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving as the closing song of Season One, “What Could Have Been” by Sting (featuring violinist Ray Chen) reminds audiences of the cold hard reality that our actions have consequences – upon individuals, upon families, and upon societies. It does this by not only illuminating Jinx’s mental turmoil, but also transcending </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s fictional narrative, evoking the audience’s personal regrets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To depict violence’s impact on individuals, “What Could Have Been” employs Díaz Gasca’s “character association” through Jinx’s violin leitmotif – a “melodic phrase… (accompanying) the reappearance of … [a] person” (Merriam-Webster 2025). In “How </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charts Tragedy,” I demonstrate how this association allows audiences to track Jinx’s mental state, with this moment marking her complete mental break. Bell Jordan’s (2016) analysis of the gender stereotypes around violin performance provides deeper insight into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s choice to represent Jinx with the violin. She reveals the traditional notion that the violin should be played solely by male violinists, for fear that its physical demand would render a woman uncouth. Women who overcome this restriction are inevitably shunned, signifying the perpetuation of discrimination. Similarly, Jinx is a victim of societal prejudice and is forced to wield violence to break free. Society then deems Jinx as monstrous, thus paralleling the perceived depravity of female violinists. This reinforces</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s motif of violence, depicting how society’s violence against individuals breeds violence in individuals against society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, “What Could Have Been” also portrays Jinx's grievance against Vi. “The Cycle Only Ends When You Walk Away” reveals how the song’s spiteful lyrics reflect the societal strife that shaped the sisters’ conflicting ideologies, ultimately fueling their mutual resentment. Imbued with intense, mournful emotions, the song thus compels audiences to bemoan the destructive impact of violence upon families.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charts Tragedy” then addresses the thought process of Alexander Seaver, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s executive music producer, in the making of “What Could Have Been.” He highlights how he deliberately manipulates the song’s instrumentals to enhance the scene’s tragedy, such as incorporating an intense violin solo. These changes effectively cause Jinx’s despair to resonate with audiences, thereby underscoring the soundtrack’s experiential impact. Furthermore, I contend that “What Could Have Been” demonstrates how multiple characters – not just Jinx – channel their grievances into violence, highlighting a shared, inescapable cycle of conflict that traps the entirety of humanity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, we must inquire if hope remains to break free of these chains of violence. “A Vision of What Can Be” subsequently explores the path towards peace as depicted in the final arc of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Season Two. I first underscore the harsh reality that society will forever bear the scars of violence. Yet by examining the significance of forgiveness amidst suffering, I also demonstrate that the strength to forgive – rather than forget – the pain and mistakes of our past, will ultimately aid us in forging a better future. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Season One finale, the song “What Could Have Been” exemplifies music’s ability to convey characters’ emotions and evoke audiences’ empathy. This experiential influence upon audiences underscores the devastating repercussions of societal violence on individuals and families, alluding to how such injustice often forces those affected to perpetuate further violence. </span><strong>Focusing on this theme, my project delves into the emotional motivations and societal dynamics that sustain this cycle, whilst further exploring what it means to attain true healing within a divided society.</strong></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/">Back to "Homepage"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/critical-reading-assignment-2/">Explore "When Sound Meets Story"</a></li><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/lyrics/">Lyrics to "What Could Have Been"</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
