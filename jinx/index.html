But unlike Vi, who was a natural fighter, Powder lacked both the physical strength and the innate skill needed for combat. Desparately yearning to prove her worth, she thus begins experimenting with mechanical weapons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her first inventions was a nail bomb, which fails pathetically in Powder's stand-off with a Zaunite gang member. This failure leads to Powder losing the treasure Vi and her team had looted. After discovering Powder's misstep, everyone but Vi snaps at Powder, blaming her for their fruitless haul. </span></p><p class="align-center">This is the first time that Powder is called a "jinx."</p><p>In a bid to save Vander from Silco (the "overlord" of Zaun), Powder's breaking point comes when another of her inventions -- a monkey bomb -- accidentally kills not only two of her fellow teammates but also her adoptive father Vander. </p><p class="align-center">In a fit of grief and shock, Vi lashes out at Powder, yet again calling her a "jinx" and seemingly abandoning her. </p><p>Unwanted and alone, Powder is taken in by Silco -- the very person who had sought to kill Vander. He becomes both her new father-figure and her manipulator. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under his twisted love, Powder transforms into Jinx -- a volatile force of chaos. Jinx is constantly haunted by voices and hallucinations of her past, who all mock her for being a "jinx." She henceforth becomes increasingly unhinged, her pain masked by manic energy and destructive genius. </span></p><p class="align-center">Despite all the blood on her hands, however, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinx is ultimately still the same girl that Vi abandoned years ago: a lonely girl, who just wants to be loved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jinx finally reunites with Vi, all she wishes for is her sister's acceptance and a return to the way things were during their childhood. Vi's hesistation, combined with the tension of the moment, causes Jinx to accidentally kill Silco. With no one left that loves her, Jinx succumbs to her violent nature, blowing up Piltover's council with her self-invented rocket. </span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEDn1G-oxqQ?si=Vs-GlnE3yojcCNca&amp;start=68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><hr><p>Relation to Piltover: </p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXVtzYuSN7o?si=lj2bFNiSqZlwYR-F&amp;start=34" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><hr><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jinx violence is far from rootless. Shaped by Zaun's deadly environment and haunted by the deaths of her loved ones, violence has become her only means of survival. Finally, trapped between who she was and what she has become, Jinx is the embodiment of a wounded heart disguised as a ticking time bomb.</span></p><hr><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/piltover/">City of Progress</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
