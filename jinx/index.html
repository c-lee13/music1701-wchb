Born as Powder, she grew up in the undercity idolizing her sister Vi and desperately trying to prove her worth. Seen as a “jinx” by others—fragile, unreliable, always making things worse—Powder’s early life was marked by failed inventions, self-doubt, and a crushing need to belong.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the death of their adoptive father Vander and Vi’s disappearance, Powder is taken in by Silco, who becomes both mentor and manipulator. Under his twisted form of love, she transforms into Jinx—a volatile, violent force of chaos. Haunted by voices and hallucinations of her past, she becomes increasingly unhinged, her pain masked by manic energy and destructive genius. She’s weaponized by Silco, turned into a symbol of Zaunite resistance, yet emotionally isolated and emotionally fragile beneath her explosive exterior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the chaos she creates, Jinx is ultimately a lonely girl who just wants to be loved—still aching for Vi’s acceptance, still mourning the childhood she lost. Her madness isn’t rootless; it’s the only language left to her in a world that never made room for her gentleness. Trapped between who she was and what she’s become, Jinx is the embodiment of a wounded heart disguised as a ticking time bomb.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEDn1G-oxqQ?si=Vs-GlnE3yojcCNca&amp;start=68" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><hr><p>Relation to Piltover: </p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXVtzYuSN7o?si=lj2bFNiSqZlwYR-F&amp;start=34" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p> </p><ul><li><a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/piltover/">City of Progress</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
