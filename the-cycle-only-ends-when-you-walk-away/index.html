The acrid odor of blood and decay chokes up your lungs and you claw at your throat. A strangled plea breaks free. Flailing about blindly, you stumble towards the closest figure you can make out through your blurred vision. It’s a miracle you even get there. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure lies prone on the muddy soil, the outline of a rifle in their hands. Collapsing beside them, you try to ask for their canteen of water and all that comes out is a frail squeak. You shake the figure desperately on their shoulder, but they’re too focused to respond. You shake a little harder. Finally, they roll over to face you, and you brace for the onslaught of scathing insults. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None come. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your hands are covered with a crimson grime, so instead you blink rapidly to clear your vision. The soldier merely stares. Eyes travelling down their prone stance, you mean to gesture at their canteen, before you make out an insignia along their uniform – foreign from your own. Ice shoots through your veins. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One. Two. Three. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your breaths come in quick bursts but death feels no different. The forest floor is solid against your feet, and shots still reverberate in the air. Gathering courage, you peer closer. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wide eyes stare back. Their mouth hangs open in a voiceless scream. They are your enemy; yet, all you see is a terrified, young face, mirroring your own in every way.</span></p><hr><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 9 episodes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s first season, we witness two neighboring cities ripped apart by a class divide. The first city, Piltover, is steeped in gold and glory, bordering on the edge of a technological breakthrough that promises to revolutionize the very livelihoods of people. Rampant with classist prejudice, Piltover thrives off the chaos and instability of the second city, Zaun. In a desperate bid to regain power, Zaunites ingest a dangerous elixir that mutates them into powerful monsters, and they proceed to wreak havoc upon everything around them. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This recurring theme of never-ending violence is present in every episode of <i>Arcane</i>, whereby violence and greed shatter the lives of individuals, dismantle families, and bring calamity upon both cities. The song that plays in Season One’s finale, “What Could Have Been,” again underscores this tragedy by characterizing the emotions of a single individual, Jinx, depicting her broken relationship with her sister and her hatred towards society.<br></span></p><hr><h3 class="align-center">Playlist</h3><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="33.3333%" height="20%" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2IgcXz1w33nX205lPCKMaT?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><hr><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Listening Guide</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Weapon”</strong></span> by Against The Current doesn’t hesitate to throw you into its blood-pumping, high-intensity whirlwind. The mix of electronic guitar riffs and drum beats going at 180 BPM gives the song a tumultuous and powerful energy, snapping you from your daze like a jarring, yet effective, alarm. Even without lyrics, the brief introduction of the song overflows with rage and animosity, as if threatening to spill all its bottled-up hatred. This is exactly how Jinx experiences life. With her every move teetering on the edge of chaos, she is always one step away from unravelling. In her waking moments, she is tormented by her role in the war between Piltover and Zaun, bent to the manipulations of her father figure, Silco. In truth, Jinx is treated as more of a weapon than a human being, and her recognition of her violent duties is reflected in the chorus: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see red, my blood is boiling and it shows, when all you are is a weapon, you shoot 'em down 'til you end up alone.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Infected by the hatred of others, she ruins – whether involuntarily or voluntarily – everything around her, including her family. And so, she ends up completely and utterly alone. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Jinx never finds reprieve, not even in her sleeping moments, because voices in her head haunt her. She is constantly reminded of the people who abandoned her, and of the people she has murdered. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These voices create a split in Jinx’s identity, and torn between the innocence of her childhood and the violence of the present, she can no longer recognize her true self. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Skin of a Fool”</span></strong> by MIIA (featuring Vaarin) exemplifies this internal conflict. Throughout its lyrics, the song characterizes its subject from two distinct perspectives, rather than a singular point of view. The chorus’ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t talk to myself like a friend… I’m the skin of a fool and my head says I’m cruel”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflects Jinx’s mental turmoil, where the innocent part of herself cannot reconcile with her vicious actions. The bridge then states: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under this skin of mine, every lie finds its own place to hide.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All the lies that Jinx has concocted to cope with her predicament – that Vi might still love her, that the harm she has caused is of no consequence – only results in more chaos, until she can distinguish neither right from wrong nor who she really is.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constantly in a state of isolation and self-torment, how might Jinx then perceive life? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Breathe”</strong></span> by The Warning (a rock band comprised of 3 sisters), provides us a more empathetic outlook towards Jinx. Listening closely past the lyrics, the instrumentals are dominated by a piano. But rather than it being studio-recorded and pitch-perfect, the instrument used was an old family piano, thus producing a twangy and resonating melody – you can even hear the faint click of sticky keys. The vocals, too, seem to be muffled, as if you are listening in from a far-away place. This deliberate artistic imperfectness of instruments and style of vocal echoes how Jinx is plagued by her inadequacy and her supposed “brokenness.” From her childhood up til her teenage years, she has constantly brought misfortune upon those around her: her monkey bomb killing Vander (her first father figure) when it was meant to save him, her pulling the trigger on Silco (her second father figure) when she only wanted to rid the voices in her head. Jinx never </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hurt any of her family, but somehow, she cannot help it. Subsequently, the 2nd iteration of the chorus involves such raw and vulnerable vocals that it physically wrenches at our hearts. It is a simple, yet tragic, cry for help: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it so wrong, wrong to want to be alright?”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a question that comes from a desire to be different – to be unbroken. It reflects Jinx’s longing for the past, when she wasn’t defined by the mistakes that took everybody she loved away from her. But this cry falls on deaf ears, and she drowns, with no one left to help her out. </span></p><hr><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, shifting our focus from Jinx as an individual to Jinx and Vi as sisters, whilst maintaining the melodic agony of “Breathe,” we take a listen at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“My Tears Ricochet”</strong></span> by Taylor Swift. The song paints a story of loss, told from the perspective of the deceased, who addresses her surviving loved one at her own funeral: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn't have it in myself to go with grace, and you're the hero flying around, saving face.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Besides guilt, a hint of envy is woven into these lyrics. The deceased explicitly points out the heroic nature of their loved one, hinting at how this moral goodness (and her inability to replicate it) has caused a rift between the two. By putting Jinx in the shoes of the deceased and putting Vi in those of the heroic survivor, with the knowledge that Jinx has always brought harm to the family whilst Vi has always tried to protect them, this divide is further emphasized. But despite the sisters being on completely opposite sides of morality, causing them to be pitted against each other, they still share a connection: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you can aim for my heart, go for blood/But you would still miss me in your bones.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We mustn't forget about the angelic backing vocals flowing throughout the entirety of “My Tears Ricochet.” The layered vocals parallel a church choir, expressing all the sorrow and grief of the mourners to the deceased soul. Therefore, though the lyrics are set in Jinx’s perspective, the backing vocals can be interpreted as Vi’s emotions, revealing the persisting love she has for her sister, even if they have become enemies. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis Capaldi’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Before You Go”</strong></span> expands on Vi’s grief, whereby she mourns their broken sisterhood (a variation of death). It is a song that represents what Vi might have wanted to say towards Jinx, had she known and better understood Jinx’s pain. The line</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similarly reflects that despite the sisters’ clashing ideologies and moralities, Vi can never bring herself to truly hate Jinx. The chorus then states: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better? If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and coupled with Capaldi’s raspy and emotional delivery, it depicts the regret that Vi would’ve felt at how she had given up on her sister – how she had let her drown under the weight of her loneliness. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet both “My Tears Ricochet” and “Before You Go” are set in the aftermath of Jinx’s “death,” and Vi only expresses her love for her sister when it is too late. As in the 1st season of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both sisters remain consumed by hatred, refusing to accept or forgive the changes in each other. As such, the rift between the sisters is never healed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us to the song of the season finale, and the inspiration for this playlist, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“What Could Have Been”</strong></span> by Sting (featuring Ray Chen on the violin). Told from Jinx’s perspective, the song is imbued with a much more spiteful outlook, peppered with violent imagery like the 1st verse: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You ripped out all my parts… for me to live, I gotta kill the part of me that saw, that I needed you more.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unbeknownst to the fact that Vi was imprisoned for all her teenage years, Jinx blames Vi for abandoning her. With her world turned upside down, Jinx loses the trust and innocence of her childhood, and is instead consumed by hatred and violence – the very opposite of who she once was. Yet, some tiny part of her still yearns for Vi’s love, and to escape from the agony of being torn apart by two separate identities, Jinx must eliminate her past, innocent self, as shown by the 2nd verse: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am your ghost, a fallen angel.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Sting’s stunning, soulful vocals take precedence in the 1st half of the song, the highlight of the 2nd half of “What Could Have Been” is actually Ray Chen’s magnificent violin solo. Coming in right before the 2nd chorus, the smooth and flowy bow strokes turn sharp and jittery. This parallels Jinx’s increasingly frenzied state of mind after Vi’s hesitation at their reunion and after Jinx accidentally kills Silco. She then comes to the realization that she is now completely alone. The violin climaxes in an agonizingly beautiful sequence of long, drawn-out notes, rejoined by Sting’s chorus. But here, the violin seems to overshadow the lyrics – it is the violin that truly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cries</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sings of the grief that Jinx experiences. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the 1st line in the outro of the song: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want you to hurt like you hurt me today</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves to emphasize a central theme of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that violence is a cycle. It was the strife between Piltover and Zaun that first hurt the two sisters. Then, it was the two sisters hurting each other. Finally, it will be Jinx who tears apart Piltover. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But whilst we often cannot define the beginning of the cycle, it is clear, here, that the root of the problem lies within society itself. </span></p><hr><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To return to the root of the problem, we must first go back chronologically to before violence festers in the minds of people – to our pure, innocent childhood. In Taylor Swift’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“I Hate It Here,”</strong></span> the narrator longs for a fantasy land far away from the fears and pressures of society. She then recounts a game she used to play, where she would pick </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a decade [they] could live in instead of this,”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> furthering the child-like aura of the narrative. Similarly, the squeak of the acoustic guitar, strummed softly in a recurring pattern, exudes simplicity and peacefulness. This instrumental backing compels us to think back to our own childhood, when no worries could plague us – almost like a lullaby. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, this childhood is merely a brief moment in our lives. The narrator’s response to the game, that she would live in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the 1830s, but without all the racists and getting married off for the highest bid,”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduces an air of somberness. Her maturity also contrasts with the easygoing instrumentals, alluding to how she is burdened by her knowledge of societal issues, and has been forced to grow up too quickly. Born into calamity, the children of Zaun have no choice but to forsake their peaceful childhood for survival. Still, before the poison of society gets to them, they yearn for a different life: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind, when they found a better planet only the gentle survived.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This longing is depicted in Jinx’s and Vi’s astonishment at the airship (something they’ve only seen in their fantasies) in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 1st episode. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, this innocence is soon tainted by hatred, feeding further into the cycle of violence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Lullaby,”</strong></span> this song by Against The Current is far from the soothing nature of “I Hate It Here” – both instrumentally and lyrically. The pre-chorus introduces a figure of power: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the gods keep saying you've been warned, they leave you stranded in their storm,”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illuminating the neglect and abuse that these gods exert upon “lower” beings. It then poses the (rhetorical) question from the perspective of the abused:</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are monsters made or are they born?</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Likewise, there exists a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stark power dynamic between Piltover (the gods) and Zaun (the monsters), whereby Piltover pays no heed to how its actions have repercussions against Zaun. Rather, Piltover deliberately plunges the latter city into poverty and discord, forcing innocent people to turn (both literally and figuratively) into monsters for survival. Despite Zaun's evident suffering, Piltover continues to turn a blind eye, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“dreaming when the world’s a nightmare”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Zaun’s] cries were just another lullaby.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This supposed “City of Progress” thus lies in an ignorant bubble, finding profiting – and even delight – in this societal divide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our final song in the playlist is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“Blood // Water”</strong></span> by Grandson, a song that concretizes greed as the cause of the cities’ gaping societal chasm. The chorus mocks </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter… the price of your greed is your son and your daughter.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rather than Piltover inflicting pain on Zaun like in “Lullaby,” “Blood // Water” has Zaun snatching power away from their dictators, portraying the destruction and vengeance that Zaun will not hesitate to wreak upon Piltover. The vocals then turn guttural, accompanied by a screeching electronic-rock instrumental with an intense tempo of 154 BPM. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the people/I am the storm/I am the riot/I am the swarm</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> therefore becomes Zaun’s chant of rebellion. No longer </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“stranded in [Piltover’s storm],”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but instead united by a common hatred, the Zaunites turn the storm towards Piltover. </span></p><hr><p class="align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what has changed? </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, at the finale of the playlist, the cycle is only reinforced: Piltover wields violence to subdue Zaun; Zaun expresses its resentment in equal onslaughts of violence. Society ruptures even more, and this strife cleaves apart countless families, which then shatters the lives of innocent individuals. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now, consequently, brought back to the start of our playlist: “Weapon.”</span></p><hr><p class="dropcap"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soldier! Don’t just stand there!” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice in the distance shouts, jerking you from your daze, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIRE!”</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don't want to. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's wrong!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your mind screams. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the feeble sounds of your protest fall onto deaf ears, as you become only vaguely aware of your actions: Your fingers tremble as they move to reload your rifle. It takes you three attempts before you finally hear the distinct click that has consumed your entire existence. You crouch down, aligning the barrel with a faint shimmer of movement you see behind a row of trees. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your finger rests on the trigger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunfire rings out.</span></p><p class="dropcap"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p><hr><h3 class="align-center">To <a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/a-vision-of-what-could-be/">Break</a> or To <a href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/how-arcane-charts-tragedy-through-what-could-have-been/">Repeat</a> The Cycle</h3></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://c-lee13.github.io/music1701-wchb/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
